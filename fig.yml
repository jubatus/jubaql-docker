# To demo JubaQL to a full extent, we need a Hadoop/HDFS/YARN cluster
# and a Kafka queue. Also, we need data in these sources, so we also
# add a fluentd container to pipe data into HDFS and Kafka.

# Kafka needs a Zookeeper instance. This does not need much configuring,
# so we just take a standard image.
